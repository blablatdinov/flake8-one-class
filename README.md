## Background

Implementation inheritance can lead to brittle and hard-to-maintain code. By enforcing the use of the `@final` decorator, this plugin aims to encourage composition over inheritance, promoting better software design principles.

[yegor256 blog post](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/09/13/inheritance-is-procedural.html)

## Installation

To install `flake8-one-class`, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install flake8-one-class
```

## Usage

After installing the plugin, flake8 will automatically use it when you run the following command:

bash

flake8 your_project_directory

The plugin will check each class definition to ensure it has a @final decorator. If a class is missing the @final decorator, an error will be reported.

## Example

Given the following Python code:

```python
class MyClass:
    pass
```

Running flake8 will produce the following error:

```
your_file.py:1:1: FOC100 class must be final
```

Adding the `@final` decorator will resolve the error:

```python
from typing import final

@final
class MyClass:
    pass
```
